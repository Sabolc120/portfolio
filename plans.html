            <h1>Honestly, what I think about the world of software development?</h1>
            <p>Well first of, lets start with how I begun to get into this whole thing. As a highschool student I showed some kind of talent to IT and to different technology and I loved studying about it. By the end I reached the end of hardware components, and networking components, I started to show interest in coding and I also showed a huge will to create something new, to make something new from scratch, I love creating.</p>
            <p>My dad especially wanted me to be a software developer and I started chasing this dream to be a developer, but there was a huge letdown which was a very serious problem, family problems started to begun, and turned out I cant continue my studies and go to university, this was a huge slap from life itself, as I clearly knew that if I want to take this field seriously I must go to higher education also, because the sad reality is that whenever I tried to go to different companies, they wanted me to be a university student and not an OKJ student, around  ~70% of my rejects were because of this problem.</p>
            <p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1035540982101446679/1140941919371927563/giphy.png" class="pic"></p>
            <p>After all this, I got into a dark pit and just gave up this field because I had to start thinking about moving out and I lost my motivation too, and I had to search my own money, and I didnt had the chance to risk it, and now I am working in a fast food restaurant chain, probably the worst job I have ever done.</p>
            <p>In my opinion software development is the most amazing current field on the world, as this is the future, and I want to take part in formating this future, as this is a huge task and a very challangeing and interesting field.</p>

        <h1>What are your plans now, how do you want your grand return to start and finish?</h1>
          <p>Now that OpenAI became something everyone knows about, I dont think I need to introduce them. I started showing huge interests in AIs, and my dream is to make an AI for entertainment purposes like livestreaming and interacting with people, which already exists, just not really known.</p>
          <p>I had a taste of economy and fast food chains as a work, and I am already feeling like this field is just wont be for me, and that I should return to development, and make it to work, whatever it takes</p>
          <p>Software development is a huge field, and it takes an enourmous amount of time to make it working, this is why I have a long-run plans, I am writing this text at 2023.08.15., so by the time someone reads it it should be around half year later or even more. My plan is to review everything, and start fresh, and practice, practice, practice, I cant say it enough times "practice".</p>
          <p>Honestly, I have no idea how long it will takes, because I work 12 hours everyday in economy, but if you are reading this site, that means I am finally ready to go to interviews again as I am prepared properly. I hope we will be able to meet soon, so I can proove my skills to you!</p>
